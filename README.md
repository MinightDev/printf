# Custom printf Implementation

This is a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C, called `_printf`, which provides basic formatting capabilities. The project consists of several files:

- / **1-functions.c, 2-functions.c, 3-custom.c**: These files contain various functions used in the custom printf implementation, divided into multiple files for better organization.

- / **for_testing.txt**: This file is not used in the code and is likely provided as a placeholder for testing purposes.

- / **handlers.c**: This file contains functions to handle different custom format specifiers such as `%b`, `%S`, `%r`, and `%R`.

- / **main.c**: The main file contains the `main` function, which is used for testing the custom `_printf` function with various format strings.

- / **main.h**: The header file contains the function prototypes used in the implementation. It is included by other files to access function declarations.

- / **_printf.c**: The main implementation file contains the custom `_printf` function, which emulates the behavior of the standard `printf` function with limited format specifiers.
